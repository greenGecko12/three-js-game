                        You start at one end of a plane and have to reach the other end in as quick as time as possible.

                        Don't the touch the red tiles or you lose a life. You start with 3 lives and you lose if you
                        lose
                        all three lives. The number of lives is represented by the number of hearts at the top left of
                        the
                        screen.

                        If you ever need to read these instructions again then press the "Esc" key on your keyboard. If
                        you
                        want to navigate back to the menu page, press the back on your browser to get back to index.html
                        from where you'll be able to play Level 1. Alternatively, you can just click the button below
                        which
                        will do the same job.
                    </p>
                    <p> Oh, one thing I forgot to mention is that you can't look forward! Otherwise, the game would be
                        way
                        too easy!!! To
                        have a peek forward, press "B" on your keyboard.</p>
