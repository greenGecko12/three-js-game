# three-js-game

A mini 3D game using the three.js library

Need to install three-js before running locally.

First level is a simple zombie shooting game in first person

Level two consists of trying to run across a bridge in third person whilst trying to avoid the moving tiles but you can only look backwards!.

NOTE: you might need to change the import references before the code works for you.
